3.23
 - Rename Rmpfr_get_decimal64, Rmpfr_set_decimal64, Rmpfr_get_float128 & Rmpfr_set_float128
       to Rmpfr_get_DECIMAL64, Rmpfr_set_DECIMAL64, Rmpfr_get_FLOAT128 & Rmpfr_set_FLOAT128
 - Provide Rmpfr_get_float128 & Rmpfr_set_float128 which pass the __float128 value as an NV
 - Ensure that when casting an IV/NV to an mpfr_t, the mpfr_t has enough precision to
   accurately represent the value.
 - No longer define USE_64_BIT_INT if ivtype is 'long'. (Thus had to tweak some test files.)
 - Rename USE_64_BIT_INT #define to MATH_MPFR_NEED_LONG_LONG_INT
 - Define IVSIZE_BITS (in XS file) if MATH_MPFR_NEED_LONG_LONG_INT is defined - for use in
   initialization of mpfr_t in some of the overload functions.
 - Add FLOAT128_DIG

3.22
 - Add some metadata to Makefile.PL.
 - Fix the LNGAMMA_BUG workaround in mpfr.c, and change test 69 in t/test1.t to
   test for correct behaviour of mpfr_lngamma().
 - Add Rmpfr_set_NV - and use it in new().
 - Remove Rmpfr_sprintf_ret and Rmpfr_snprintf_ret.
 - No longer include inttypes.h on the basis of USE_LONG_DOUBLE being defined.
   (Was harmless ... but didn't make much sense.)
 - Define PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT.
 - Tweaks to Math::MPFR::gmp_v() and Math::MPFR::V::gmp_v()

3.21
 - Fix errors in t/decimal64_conv.t

3.19
 - Rewrite _wrap_mpfr_sprintf(), _wrap_mpfr_snprintf(), _wrap_mpfr_sprintf_rnd()
   and _wrap_mpfr_snprintf_rnd(). Their first arg has been changed from a char*
   to an SV*, and they take an additional argument that specifies the size of
   the buffer (1st arg) into which the resultant string is written.
 - Change Rmpfr_sprintf_ret() and Rmpfr_snprintf_ret(). The first arg (buffer)
   has been removed, and an additional argument that specifies the size of the
   buffer into which the resultant string is written needs to be provided.
 - Fix spelling error in doc. Thanks Salvatore Bonaccorso. (Ticket #89710)
 - Add Rmpfr_set_float128 and Rmpfr_get_float128. These provide access to the
   '__float128' data type (for compilers that support the type) via the
   Math::Float128 module.
 - Simplify querying of Decimal64 support in the mpfr library being used
 - Add MPFR_DBL_DIG, MPFR_LDBL_DIG, mpfr_max_orig_len, mpfr_min_inter_prec,
    mpfr_min_inter_base and mpfr_max_orig_base.
 - Have lngamma(-0) be +Inf instead of NaN. (Bug in mpfr 3.1.2 and earlier.)

3.18
 - Depending upon the rounding mode values, the mpfr library may incorrectly return
   false for mpfr_fits_u*_p(x) for -1.0 < x < 0.0 or for -0.5 < x <0.0. (This
   should be fixed in versions of mpfr later than 3.1.2.)
   Have the Rmpfr_fits_u*_p() functions return  correct result irrespective of the
   version of mpfr being used - and have the Math:MPFR test suite test for this.
 - The 'P' type specifier (precision) wasn't working correctly on big-endian machines
   when mp_prec_t size is less than IV size. Add a prec_cast function to fix this.
 - Add an _mp_sizes function (not exportable) that returns the sizes of mpfr_exp_t,
   mpfr_prec_t and mpfr_rnd_t.
 - Add Math::MPFR::_ivsize (not exportable).
 - Add Math::MPFR::_nvsize (not exportable).
 - Correct the Rmpfr_*printf functions so that they croak with an appropriate error
   message if a rounding arg is supplied but the last arg is not a Math::MPFR object.

3.17
 - Apply patch to MPFR.xs from Daniel Kahn Gillmor that eliminates
   "null argument where non-null required" warnings.
 - Fix typo in croak() message in MPFR.xs (also caught by Daniel).

3.16
 - Add Rmpfr_set_LD() and Rmpfr_get_LD(). These provide access to the
   'long double' data type (for perls whose nvtype is double) via the
   Math::LongDouble module.

3.15
 - Add _Decimal64-mpfr_t conversion

3.14
 - Fix pod. (The '±' symbol was causing pod.t failures.) Also took care of
   some other typos/oversights in the documentation.

3.13
 - Add Math::MPFR::V
 - Add pre/post increment/decrement operations (overload_add and overload_inc)
 - Allow (cross-class) overloading of basic math operations with Math::GMPz,
   Math::GMPq and Math::GMPf objects.

3.12
 - Remove 'not' from overloads. Apparently achieved nothing anyway, and 5.16
   warns that it's invalid.

3.11
 - Add t/tls.t and t/tls_flags.t (to test the thread local storage capabilities,
   where applicable).
3.10
 - Add the following functions (conditional upon building against
   mpfr-3.1.0 or later):
   Rmpfr_set_divby0, Rmpfr_clear_divby0, Rmpfr_divby0_p, Rmpfr_buildopt_tune_case,
   Rmpfr_frexp, Rmpfr_grandom, Rmpfr_z_sub, Rmpfr_buildopt_gmpinternals_p.
 - Add Rgmp_randinit_mt.
 - In Rmpfr_get_d_2exp and Rmpfr_get_ld_2exp, replace sv_setuv (was incorrect)
   with sv_setiv.
 - Replace New/Newz with Newx/Newxz on perls that support the new symbols (Newx/Newxz).
3.02
 - Rmpfr_min_prec now available only when building against mpfr-3.0.0 or later. (The
   mpfr_min_prec function was not available until 3.0.0.)
3.01
 - Remove the (outdated) link to http://www.loria.fr/projets/mpfr/mpfr-current/mpfr.html
   in the "DESCRIPTION" section of the documentation. (Thanks Hugh Myers.)
 - In the documentation, elaborate on the way that Rmpfr_get-version() and
   MPFR_VERSION & friends determine their values. (Thanks Vincent Lefevre.)
 - Correct Rmpfr_min_prec(), and remove Rmpfr_max_prec().
3.0
 - Corresponding to release of mpfr-3.0.0. (Still needs only 2.4.0,
   but 3.0.0 needed to take advantage of all features.)
 - Add MPFR_* rounding modes (including MPFR_RNDA for builds against
   mpfr-3.0.0)
 - Add Rmpfr_buildopt_tls_p() and Rmpfr_buildopt_decimal_p() (mpfr-3.0.0 only)
 - Add the following functions, specific to mpfr-3.0.0: Rmpfr_regular_p,
   Rmpfr_set_zero, Rmpfr_digamma, Rmpfr_ai, Rmpfr_set_flt, Rmpfr_get_flt,
   Rmpfr_urandom and Rmpfr_set_z_2exp.
 - Add Rmpfr_get_z_2exp (mpfr_get_z_exp is now renamed to mpfr_get_z_2exp).
 - Add gmp_randstate_t* to the Math::MPFR typemap.
 - Change handling of NaNs (wrt overloaded comparison operators).
   The overloaded spaceship operator now returns undef when NaNs are involved
   (more in keeping with perl behaviour), and the erange flag is now
   set whenever a comparison involving NaNs is performed (more in
   keeping with the mpfr library behaviour). This is irrespective
   of whether the NaN is a Math::MPFR object or a perl NV.
   The other comparison operators now also set the erange flag when
   a NaN is involved (for compatibility with the mpfr library).
 - Add Rmpfr_snprintf and Rmpfr_snprintf_ret.
 - Add Rmpfr_inits, Rmpfr_inits2 and Rmpfr_clears functions.
 - The overload_copy sub now preserves the precision of the copied
   object (instead of taking on default precision).
2.03
 - Needs version 2.4.0 (or later) of the mpfr library.
 - Add the following functions (new in mpfr-2.4.0):
   Rmpfr_add_d, Rmpfr_sub_d, Rmpfr_d_sub Rmpfr_mul_d, Rmpfr_div_d,
   Rmpfr_d_div, Rmpfr_rec_sqrt, Rmpfr_sinh_cosh, Rmpfr_li2, Rmpfr_zeta_ui,
   Rmpfr_modf, Rmpfr_fmod, Rmpfr_printf, Rmpfr_fprintf, Rmpfr_sprintf,
   Rmpfr_sprintf_ret
 - Fix overload_sqrt() so that it returns a NaN for negative operands
   instead of croaking, as was originally the case.
 - Remove (the need for) INLINE.h
 - Add RMPFR_PREC_MIN and RMPFR_PREC_MAX.
 - Add Rmpfr_sum, Rmpfr_get_d_2exp, Rmpfr_get_ld_2exp, Rmpfr_dim,
   Rmpfr_fits_ushort_p, Rmpfr_fits_sshort_p, Rmpfr_fits_uint_p,
   Rmpfr_fits_sint_p, Rmpfr_fits_uintmax_p, Rmpfr_fits_intmax_p,
   Rmpfr_fits_IV_p, Rmpfr_fits_UV_p Rmpfr_add_si Rmpfr_get_UV
   Rmpfr_get_IV Rmpfr_get_NV

2.02
 - Add TRmpfr_out_str/TRmpfr_inp_str (which wraps mpfr_out_str/mpfr_inp_str
   more Truly than Rmpfr_out_str/Rmpfr_inp_str).
 - Rmpfr_out_str now has the option to take a prefix string.
 - Remove the tests in the Makefile.PL that test for the presence of
   a suitable compiler, GMP library and MPFR library.

2.01
 - Needs version 2.3.0 (or later) of the mpfr library.
 - Add Rmpfr_j0, Rmpfr_j1, Rmpfr_jn, Rmpfr_y0, Rmpfr_y1,
   Rmpfr_yn, Rmpfr_lgamma, Rmpfr_remainder, Rmpfr_remquo,
   Rmpfr_fms, Rmpfr_signbit, Rmpfr_setsign, and
   Rmpfr_copysign(all new in 2.3.0). Add also Rmpfr_get_patches
   (documented for the first time in 2.3.0).
 - Add Rmpfr_init_set_ld.
 - Add Rmpfr_deref2 to the list of exportable functions, and
   document it's usage in the POD section.
 - Rmpfr_deref2 now has the mpfr library allocate (and free) memory
   for the mantissa.
 - Add Rmpfr_hypot (previously missed).
 - Rmpfr_out_str now takes an optional fifth argument (a string that
   will be appended to the mpfr_out_str output). And the output
   buffer is now flushed each time Rmpfr_out_str is called.
 - Rewrite new() - to make it a little tidier.
 - Add Rmpfr_set_uj and Rmpfr_set_uj_2exp to @EXPORT_TAGS. (Previously
   overlooked.)
 - Add Rmpfr_integer_string() - mainly to provide a simple means of
   getting 'sj' and 'uj' values on a 64-bit perl where the MPFR
   library does not support mpfr_get_uj and mpfr_get_sj functions -
   which happens with libraries built with Microsoft Compilers.
 - Fix the rendering of Inf and NaN values. (Now matches the
   mpfr_out_str output for Inf and NaN.)
 - Change the format returned by Rmpfr_get_str. (Hence the output of
   Rmpfr_get_string and Math::MPFR::overload_string have changed
   from earlier versions of Math::MPFR.)
 - Fix some of the overloaded subroutines as regards their handling
   of NaN.

1.11
 - Fix bug in Rmpfr_get_str. (Sometimes printed out one less digit
   than it ought.)
 - Remove mpfr.info from distribution. Refer instead to:
   http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html
 - Have 'make clean' remove comp.exe, check.exe and version.exe.
 - Add support for perls built with -Duselongdouble
   (Rmpfr_*_ld functions, except Rmpfr_init_set_ld() which is not
    available in unpatched 2.2.1).
 - Add Rmpfr_cmp_d, Rmpfr_exp10 and the Rmpfr_*_uj functions (which
   had somehow been earlier overlooked).
 - Fix handling of unsigned long longs on perls built with -Duse64bitint.
 - Allow assignment of mpz, mpq, and mpf types using new()

1.10
 - No longer assign Exporter and DynaLoader to @Math::MPFR::ISA.
 - Add support for perls built with -Duse64bitint. This involved the
   inclusion of the Rmpfr_set_sj, Rmpfr_set_sj_2exp and Rmpfr_get_sj
   functions - as well as some alterations to the overload subs.

1.09
 - Changes to the format returned by Rmpfr_get_str and overload_string.
 - Add a new() method/function for creation of mpfr_t objects.
 - Fix Rmpfr_out_str() and Rmpfr_inp_str() - were segfaulting with
   MS compilers.


1.08
 - As of this version, MPFR-2.2.x is required.
 - Add new functions made available with the release of MPFR-2.2.0:
   Rmpfr_set_overflow Rmpfr_set_underflow Rmpfr_set_inexflag
   Rmpfr_set_erangeflag Rmpfr_set_nanflag Rmpfr_erfc Rmpfr_atan2
   Rmpfr_pow_z Rmpfr_subnormalize Rmpfr_const_catalan Rmpfr_sec
   Rmpfr_csc Rmpfr_cot Rmpfr_root Rmpfr_eint Rmpfr_get_f Rmpfr_sech
   Rmpfr_csch Rmpfr_coth Rmpfr_lngamma RMPFR_VERSION_NUM
 - Add constants (actually implemented as subroutines):
   MPFR_VERSION MPFR_VERSION_MAJOR MPFR_VERSION_MINOR
   MPFR_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL MPFR_VERSION_STRING
 - Remove Rmpfr_add_one_ulp and Rmpfr_sub_one_ulp (no longer supported
   by the MPFR library).
 - Redefine '__gmpfr_default_rounding_mode' in MPFR.xs as it's no
   longer in mpfr.h. (Been moved to mpfr-impl.h which I don't want to
   include.)
 - Rewrite of overload_atan2 - now that mpfr_atan2 is available in
   MPFR-2.2.0. (Also fixes a bug in overload_atan2).

1.07
 - New() was allocating more memory than necessary in many instances.
   Rewrote the XS code (in those instances) to fix that.
 - Add Rmpfr_strtofr


1.06
 - Modify the Makefile.PL checks added in version 1.05 to cater for
   those building with a Microsoft compiler
 - Alter Rmpfr_set_str and Rmpfr_init_set_str so that a base of 0
   can be specified - in which case the base is determined from the
   input string
 - Added the following functions:
   Rmpfr_get_ui Rmpfr_get_si Rmpfr_fits_ulong_p Rmpfr_fits_slong_p
 - Fix a bug in 'Rmpfr_deref2()' - used by 'overload_print()'
 - Provide more complete testing with 4 new test files - namely
   test4.t, trig.t, set_str.t and exceptions.t.


1.05
 - Add some checks to Makefile.PL to ensure that anyone trying to
   build this module has an up-to-date MPFR library. This is mainly
   an attempt to stop cpan testers who don't have an up-to-date MPFR
   from testing the module and subsequently reporting "FAIL" or "NA".


1.04
 - Math::MPFR-1.04 to 1.07 require MPFR-2.1.x.
 - Added the following functions, not available with versions earlier
   than 2.1.0 :
   Rmpfr_set_ui_2exp Rmpfr_set_si_2exp Rmpfr_get_z Rmpfr_si_sub
   Rmpfr_sub_si Rmpfr_mul_si Rmpfr_si_div Rmpfr_div_si Rmpfr_sqr
   Rmpfr_cmp_z Rmpfr_cmp_q Rmpfr_cmp_f Rmpfr_zero_p Rmpfr_free_cache
   Rmpfr_get_version Rmpfr_get_emin_min Rmpfr_get_emin_max
   Rmpfr_get_emax_min Rmpfr_get_emax_max Rmpfr_clear_erangeflag
   Rmpfr_erangeflag_p Rmpfr_rint_round Rmpfr_rint_trunc
   Rmpfr_rint_ceil Rmpfr_rint_floor

 - Make 'get_refcnt()' and 'get_package_name()' non-exportable.

1.02
 - Make overloading work with strings.
 - Add 'Rmpfr_dump'.
 - Add 'Math::MPFR::gmp_v' (not exportable).

1.01
 - Eradicate segfault that was occurring when 'overload_add',
   'overload_sub', 'overload_mul', 'overload_div' and 'overload_pow'
   croaked due to invalid argument(s).

0.07
 - Replace 'Rmpfr_round_prec' with 'Rmpfr_prec_round' in keeping
   with changes to the MPFR library.
 - Remove 'Rmpfr_random' (deprecated).
 - Add 'Rmpfr_cbrt', 'Rmpfr_cmpabs', ', 'Rmpfr_greater_p',

   'Rgmp_randinit_lc_2exp_size', 'Rgmp_randseed', 'Rgmp_randseed_ui',
   'Rgmp_randclear'.
 - Change module name from 'Math::GnuMPfr' to 'Math::MPFR'.

0.06
 - Add 'Rmpfr_gamma()', 'Rmpfr_zeta()', and 'Rmpfr_erf()'.
 - Add overloading for 'atan2', 'cos', 'sin', 'log', 'exp', and 'int'.

0.05
 - Requires mpfr-2.0.3
 - Add 'Rmpfr_out_str()'
 - Add 'Rmpfr_get_default_rounding_mode()'
 - Rename 'Rmpfr_set_str_raw()' to 'Rmpfr_set_str_binary()'
